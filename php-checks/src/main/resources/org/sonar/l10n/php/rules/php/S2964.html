<code>sleep</code> is sometimes used in a mistaken attempt to prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by throttling response rate. But because it ties up a thread, each request takes longer to serve that it otherwise would, making the application more vulnerable to DoS attacks, rather than less.


<h2> Noncompliant Code Example </h2>
<pre>
if (is_bad_ip($requester)) {
  sleep(5);  // Noncompliant
}
</pre>
