  A function that grows too large tends to aggregate too many responsibilities.
  Such function inevitably become harder to understand and therefore harder to maintain.

  Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor into smaller function which focus on well-defined tasks.
  Those smaller function will not only be easier to understand, but also probably easier to test.
