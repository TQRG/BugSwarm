hr_holidays_usability
=====================

This module was written to add some usability improvements on holidays management.

- do not display hours in date_from, date_to
- disable _get_number_of_days to force the user to compute himself, because
  the number of days calculated by default is incorrect (week-ends,
  public holidays). There is a TODO in hr_holidays saying it should be
  calculated based on the company calendar.
- make sure the number of days is required and > 0
