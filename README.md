[la4j (Linear Algebra for Java)](http://la4j.org)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vkostyukov/la4j.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vkostyukov/la4j)
=============================

The [**la4j**](http://la4j.org) is an open source and **100% Java** library
that provides **Linear Algebra** primitives (matrices and vectors) and algorithms. The **la4j** library was initially
designed to be a lightweight and simple tool for passionate Java developers. It has been started as student project
and turned into one of the most popular Java packages for matrices and vectors.

The key features of the **la4j** are listed bellow:

* Great performance allied with beautiful design
* No dependencies and tiny size (~150kb jar)
* Fluent and object-oriented/functional API
* Sparse (CRS, CCS) and dense (1D/2D arrays) matrices and vectors
* Linear systems solving (Gaussian, Jacobi, Seidel, Square Root, Sweep and other)
* Matrices decomposition (Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors, SVD, QR, LU, Cholesky and other)
* Functors support: predicates, functions, procedures and accumulators
* MatrixMarket/CSV IO formats support
