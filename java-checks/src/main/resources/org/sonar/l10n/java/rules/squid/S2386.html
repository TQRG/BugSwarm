<p>There is no good reason to have a mutable object as the <code>public static</code> member of an <code>interface</code>. Such variables should be moved into classes and their visibility lowered.</p>
<p>This rule checks that interfaces do not have <code>public static</code> array, <code>Collection</code>, <code>Date</code> or <code>awt.Point</code> members.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>

<pre>
public interface MyInterface {

  public static String [] strings; // Noncompliant

}
</pre>
