<p>
  Once deprecated, classes, and interfaces, and their members should be avoided, rather than used, inherited or extended.
  Deprecation is a warning that the class or interface has been superseded, and will eventually be removed.
  The deprecation period allows you to make a smooth transition away from the aging, soon-to-be-retired technology.

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
/**
 * @deprecated  As of release 1.3, replaced by {@link #Fee}
 */@Deprecated
class Fum { ... }

public class Bar extends Fum {  // Noncompliant; Fum is deprecated

  public void myMethod() {
    Foo foo = new Foo();  // okay; the class isn't deprecated
    foo.doTheThing();  // Noncompliant
  }
}
</pre>
