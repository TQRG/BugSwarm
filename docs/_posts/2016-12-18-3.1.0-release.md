# Java util native functions replaced Guava ones!

Since 3.1.0 release FluentLenium is shipped with all functional interfaces delivered with Java 8. Starting from this 
release we can say the FluentLenium library is fully Java 8 compatible.

<!-- more -->

What does it mean? FluentLenium will wrap your `Lambdas` and translate for Selenium 3.x which is still using Guava 
implementation. You can forget about casting, objects conversion and so on. FluentLenium will do all of these things 
for you gives you full Java 8 experience and makes your code cleaner and easier to maintain.  

## What's next?

Beyond all those new features, we still have ideas lying in the backlog, like 
[Cucumber](https://github.com/FluentLenium/FluentLenium/issues/318)
[Spring support](https://github.com/FluentLenium/FluentLenium/issues/337), 
[logging](https://github.com/FluentLenium/FluentLenium/issues/301), 
[visual debug](https://github.com/FluentLenium/FluentLenium/issues/322) ...

All community ideas are written in [Github issues](https://github.com/FluentLenium/FluentLenium/issues), so stay tuned 
and feel free to contribute.
