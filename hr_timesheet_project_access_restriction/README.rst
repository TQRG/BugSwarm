HR Timesheet Project Access Restriction
=======================================

This module allows you to manage the access to project by project:

An employee defined as 'manager' on a project can:
*  Manage the project,
*  See analytic accounts related to the project,
*  Read all timesheet lines for the project.

An employee member of a project can:
* See the project,
* See analytic accounts related to the project and therefore create timesheet lines on these analytic accounts,
* See their own timesheet line related to the project.
