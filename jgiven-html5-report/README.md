# A HTML5 Report for JGiven

Uses the power of AngularJS, Foundation, and Font Awesome

## Advantages compared to the static HTML report
* It requires less space, because only a single JSONP file has to be generated that is used as input instead of many HTML files for each tag and class
* It is dynamic ;-), so expect that there will be additional features in the HTML5 report that are not available in the static one
