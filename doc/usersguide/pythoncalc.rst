    # PythonCalc
    #
    # A VisTrails package is simply a Python class that subclasses from
    # Module.  For this class to be executable, it must define a method
    # compute(self) that will perform the appropriate computations and set
    # the results.
    #
    # Extra helper methods can be defined, as usual. In this case, we're
    # using a helper method op(self, v1, v2) that performs the right
    # operations.

        # You need to report the ports the module wants to make
        # available. This is done by creating _input_ports and
        # _output_ports lists composed of InputPort (IPort) and OutputPort
        # (OPort) objects. These are simple ports that take only one
        # value. We'll see in later tutorials how to create compound ports
        # which can take a tuple of values.  Each port must specify its
        # name and signature.  The signature specifies the package
        # (e.g. "basic" which is shorthand for
        # "org.vistrails.vistrails.basic") and module (e.g. "Float").
        # Note that the third input port (op) has two other arguments.
        # The "enum" entry_type specifies that there are a set of options
        # the user should choose from, and the values then specifies those
